I'm happily married with two amazing kids in college. 

My work life is focused mostly on data sciences, text mining and biological knowledge representation. For both work and play, I'm also an insatiably curious lifelong learner. 

My play time is generally oriented towards participatory activities, judo, hapkido, hiking, general fitness or enjoying the quiet world of a good book.
