The post-secondary academic system and the college loan business are killing our economy. Everywhere you look there is degree inflation associated with jobs. This adds the burden of additional debt to the individual with no additional productivity gains for them or our society.
I have a PhD in Bioinformatics which is a field that requires both a high degree of theory and practice. I'm definitely not against college or graduate training where it makes sense, but receptionists do NOT need a master's degree as is required in some markets in the US.
We need to be a lot clearer in our understanding of what is needed to be successful in a field of work. Do Nurse-Practitioners need a PhD to be successful in treating patients? There is a push right now to require doctorates to become a Nurse-Practitioner. Given that Physicians are not required to have a PhD, it seems quite idiotic (unless of course you are the person running a PhD program for Nurse-Practitioner's and happen to be on the Certification Board for Nurse-Practitioner's).
As a nation, we keep confusing skills development with theory/academic development.
