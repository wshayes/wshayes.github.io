Excellent points.  Doesn't really matter if the climate is changing or how much we have impacted it.  What matters is that fossil fuels are not sustainable due to basic supply - pendantic types can argue about whether it is 15 years away or 50, but it WILL HAPPEN within my or my children's lifetime.  
  
In fact, I think the whole climate change issue is moot.  I think the timeframe between the earliest time we can get shifted to a sustainable energy economy and when oil is practically unavailable is likely to be quite short.  After the oil runs out, we will be carbon neutral.
