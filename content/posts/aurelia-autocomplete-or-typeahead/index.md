Autocompletes can be tricky.  Being new to front-end web development I had a lot of trepidation regarding implementing one for my current project.  Fortunately after nearly tearing my hair out over the many versions of Twitter Typeahead - most of which I couldn't figure out, I ran across [Patrick Walter's](https://github.com/PWKad) implementation for his Aurelia demo site [Staurelia Wars](https://github.com/PWKad/staurelia-wars).  His src/templates/type-ahead code was the basis for this Example.  
  
I learned from and changed his example implementation of an autocomplete and am documenting what I did and why so that in a couple of months when I need to do this again - I'll remember how :)
