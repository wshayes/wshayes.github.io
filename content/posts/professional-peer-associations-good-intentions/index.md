If members of a group are resisting change, gathering members of that group together reinforces that resistance.  Charlynn and I have seen this behavior with a professional group to which we have belonged.  Professional peer groups can reinforce bad behavior as well as good - just depends on the density of will - though too much dissension causes fractures into more homogeneous subgroups.
