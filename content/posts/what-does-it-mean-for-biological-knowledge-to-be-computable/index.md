Consistency, migration, analytics, conversions

### Notes from Wendy:

Who is your target audience for this? [Biologists and potential investors and provide examples for computational biologists]

If it is bioinformatics professionals, it is spot on and perfect. If it is for one of Judith’s emails, it is perfect. If it is for Branding, it is perfect. [Not for Branding — but support for Marketing]

If it is targeted at Joe Average Biologist or Physician, it needs translating. To Joe Average you have defined Jargon (Computable) with more Jargon. [Plan to provide specific examples]

When you say: Joe thinks:

Consistency, Huh?? Do you mean [***reproducibility***](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS860US860&q=reproducibility&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahMyZzaHoAhV0hHIEHRrxA_cQkeECKAB6BAgTECY) ? [

Migration, What? Birds? Whales? From where to where?

Analytics, Like in Quantitative Biology??

Conversions From What to what? Why?

If your target is [Jeremy Zucker](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/q01vyayo/users/5e67d69cb665be791aed18a3), DO Not Change a thing! You speak the same language. This will intrigue all the Jeremy Zuckers. Great Choice of image by the way- it invites you to sit down and read the text.

If you want to broaden the appeal, You need to expand on consistency, migration, analytics, and conversions, so Joe has a clue what you are talking about. This can be done with one sentence for each in a paragraph, or a list of bullets.

So who are you targeting?

### Notes from Wm

I plan to expand it out — but I’ll try to add a TL/DR section at the beginning.

For Consistency Analysis — Wendy can you find some examples where there are BEL statements that contradict each other in the nanopub that are biologically relevant where we can exemplify the difference in Annotations (or initially show that the annotations are the same but deeper analysis and addition of experimental context shows they are different — that would be even better — even if we have to mock it up somewhat). If you have trouble with that in the Selventa KB (if you know of good examples from your personal knowledge of biology — that would be good as well) — I can write a script to check for inconsistencies.

Migration/Conversions — as the BEL language changes — since it’s computable we can generally migrate it to the new form (or a new format completely) automatically as it’s parseable and manipulable using computers which English is not.

Analytics — the knowledge is immediately accessible for analytics as you don’t have to reformat English into a format that is possible to analyze.
