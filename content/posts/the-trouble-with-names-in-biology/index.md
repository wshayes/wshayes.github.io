**NOTE — update HGNC namespace and confirm that outdated HGNC:MARCH1 gets converted to correct name before publishing this!**

Handling names and identifiers in Biology is hard. Names and identifiers are always changing for various reasons, including Microsoft Excel as seen in the story linked below. Everyone seems to use a different name for that thing you are interested in making research so very hard.

*Scientists have renamed 27 human genes to stop Microsoft Excel misreading them as dates. The changes have been underway…*www.theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates "https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates")

What we do in BioDati Studio is manage those names, synonyms, identifiers, and outdated names like the [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/) gene symbol: *MARCH1* which keeps being converted to a date in Excel spreadsheets, so that nomenclature stays current and everyone understands what you are talking about.
