I guess I don’t read Umair’s essays with the understanding that he’s against capitalism as a component of a managed economy. My readings have led me to believe that he’s for entrepreneurism and capitalism, but it’s not blind Ayn Rand, the almighty dollar, capitalism. Capitalism with managed/guided markets to allow an open playing field fits in well with what he’s written. Capitalism as the entire focus of our economy is a mistake, and that’s the direction we’ve been heading for the last several decades. You in your rebuttal have also suggested that this is not what our country (world) needs.

Our current system destroys opportunity by proposing that it’s all a free market when it is very much not. If you are born to the right family — the world is yours. If you get really lucky and are very, very capable, you have a chance of breaking into that 0.00001%. This is all at the expense of cycling the rest of humanity into an ever-increasing inequality of wealth and power. These societies lead to either stagnation/lack of progress or revolution.

With no frontier available to siphon off the revolutionary troublemakers, I suspect we’ll see revolution much faster than ever before.

The fact is that the US is a socialist democracy with almost 50% of government spending being entitlements. Our spending could be more effective/efficient if we were not so enamored by free markets (and really big money in politics). Our government spending should be to improve societal health which it currently does but there is too much moralizing and not enough objective/rational thought.

Humanity — caring for others makes the entire society stronger and more resilient. Diversity brings more creativity and ideas into the mix for problem solving.
