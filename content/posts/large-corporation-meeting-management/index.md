I was talking to Kevin Clougherty who I used to work with, and he had a great idea for managing the over-proliferation of meetings.  Run a meeting budget and charge for meetings.

Chargeback for meeting resources (rooms, etc) and personnel involved in the meetings (e.g. $400/hr for VP's, $250/hr for Directors, $150/hr for Analysts, etc).  This would encourage smaller, more focused meetings and highlight people over-using meetings.
