### Fable of the Porcupine:

It was the coldest winter ever, and many animals died because of the cold. The porcupines, realizing the situation, decided to group together to keep warm, but the quills of each one wounded their closest companions. After a while, they decided to distance themselves from one another, but then they began to die, alone and frozen.

They had to make a choice: Either accept the quills of their companions or die. Wisely, they learned to live with the little wounds caused by their close relationships, in order to receive the heat that came from the others. This way they were able to survive.

### Moral of the story:

The best relationship is not the one that brings together perfect people; it's when each individual learns to live with the others' imperfections and can admire their good qualities.

### Background:

A friend of mine, Nils Onsager, Master Hapkido Instructor, shared this with me.  I found it an excellent parable for diversity and the challenges inherent in diversity.
