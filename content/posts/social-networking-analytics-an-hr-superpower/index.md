#### What is Social Networking?

Social Networking Analysis (SNA) allows you to evaluate the relationships between individuals and departments based on their communications via phone, email and meeting requests.

#### Why would we want to perform Social Networking?

This is a tool that HR can use to coach individuals and departments and help mature departments (especially support departments such as R&D DNA Sequencing, IT, HR, Faciliites, etc) from non-interacting entities (mode 1) to order taking (mode 2) to fully collaborative partners (mode 3).

From the referenced paper ([Singer-RandDAnalysis.doc](http://camlxlib02.biogenidec.com/misc/miscfiles/books/Singer-RandDAnalysis.doc)) by Jean Singer and John Helferich:

> In the social network view, performance is the result of not just individual capabilities but of the relationships among people and the ways in which they bring their collective resources to bear upon the organization’s goals. (See, for example, Brass, Galaskiewicz, Greve, & Tsai, 2004; Scott, 2000) The techniques of social network analysis provide a window on working relationships by measuring and displaying the connections that exist among members of various organizations.

> An SNA can identify where information is flowing freely among co-workers, and where it is bottled up behind organizational lines. It can show where people go for advice, whom they trust, and whether or not they are aware of the diversity of knowledge that lies beyond their immediate circles of colleagues. Importantly for support groups, SNA can reveal the nature of their relationships with internal customers: where different types of relationships exist and whether they are characterized by one-way transactions or more collaborative, two-way partnerships. With a shared understanding of current interactions, support groups and their customers can build consensus around the types of relationships that are needed to strengthen and streamline process flows, and take joint action to build them.

#### How would we accomplish this?

Collect email header information (only the From, To lines), capture the phone logs of who calls whom, start capturing Microsoft Lync logs if possible and capture the calendar meeting host and invitees into a database.  Process the results to summarize the links between people and departments over different time frames based on a weighted measure of linkage.  Linkage between two individuals for example will be a weighted measure of their email, phone, IM communications and hours of meetings scheduled.

We can then provide datasets and a visualization tool to show how specific departments or teams interact both intra- and inter-departmentally.
