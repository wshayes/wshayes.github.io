If you don't know about the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) Q&A website, it's worth a look to get a better understanding of how crowd sourcing can work for distributed answer generation.

There are a couple of open-source tools that we could pilot to test how it would work at Biogen Idec.  Is anybody interested in piloting this?
