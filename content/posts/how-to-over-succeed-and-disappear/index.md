> Sometimes the reward for being super successful at your job is disappearing.

I once worked as a bouncer in a bar. It was a mess with lots of fights and disturbances. The bar manager decided they wanted to shift to a more refined and hopefully deeper pocket crowd and wanted the fights to end. That’s actually pretty easy to do if you have the right security team. Very few fights start with a punch, there is usually a good bit of posturing beforehand and the crowd in a bar just moves differently when a fight is about to start. I’m not sure how to describe it, but you get a feel for something in the crowd even if you can’t see anything. Anyway, we built up a good crew and typically before any fights even started, we had the instigators out of the bar with little fuss and no drama. After a few weeks, the bar manager fired us because it was nice and quiet and they didn’t need any security since no one was fighting (though that didn’t last long). This was an early lesson on disappearing due to being overly successful.

I’ve worked with system administrators both good, bad, and great. The good ones have a critical issue that shows up that results in people not having access to servers/network/etc every once in a while — you typically remember who they are because they are heroes — something breaks and they are there to fix it for you. The bad ones, the bad ones are always trying to fix things — everything seems to break around them. They don’t seem heroic as they are always dealing with fires and probably starting most of them.

The great sysadmins are hard to remember. I just remember periods at work where all of the IT systems just worked, all of the time, if there was a glitch I usually found out when I got a short note from the SysAdmin that told me for example there was a disk failure and it was resolved already before I even noticed any issues. The great SysAdmins just disappear. They don’t seem heroic because they are never seen to do anything. They are not only the true heroes, they are the best of us. They are quietly doing their job with extreme competence.

Disappearing at work or in life can happen anywhere you have someone who quietly and extremely competently gets the job done. Never had a serious fire in your town? very low crime compared to surrounding areas? think about what works really well and what is noticed only when it doesn’t work (water and electricity are great examples — these services are typically provided with incredible success rates, unbelievable actually, but we take them for granted. Do you even remember when you last noticed people working on the electrical lines or water pipes?

I’m not suggesting we do a good enough job so we don’t disappear. Actually, I guess I pretty much am, because we, in general, are not good enough to take the high road and celebrate excellence when it doesn’t trumpet itself with great fanfare through heroic deeds.

Just remember, nothing runs smoothly without a lot of effort by someone or several someones. If something is running so smoothly that you don’t even think about it, the people who made that happen should be celebrated not disappear.
