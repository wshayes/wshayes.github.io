I’m fascinated by the [technology](https://www.openwater.cc/technology) of [OpenWater](https://www.openwater.cc), a company founded by [Dr Mary Lou Jepsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_Jepsen) (CTO of One Laptop per Child, holography expert, …). I cannot speak as an expert in the field of imaging technologies, but I would like to raise some potential opportunities if the technology is as promising as Dr Jepsen indicates (and she has a very strong history of delivering).

OpenWater is working on imaging technology that will be cheap enough and robust enough to deploy everywhere (first/third world, your home, mall kiosk, as a hat or vest, …). It uses infrared and ultrasonic imaging that can penetrate flesh and bone to approximately 15cm (6 inches). It is reported to be possible (and looking forward to the demos of it).

Resolution/cost — about 1,000–100,000X cheaper than an MRI (they range in cost from [$150k — $5M](http://time.com/money/2995166/why-does-mri-cost-so-much/) and incredibly cheap to operate in comparison

Blood — tumor 0.5mm resolution— blood flow — oxygenated vs non-oxygenated blood flow, sub-second response time for video imaging

fMRI resolution — 10 cubic mm (8:52), MRI — cubic mm (8:56), OpenWater — cubic microns (9:00) — down to single neuron level (9:06) — read and write neuron states (9:12) — focused ultrasound — ablation (14:12), blood-brain barrier disruption (14:27)

I’ve had some thoughts on how we could use this technology in a lot of ways to transform biology and our work culture.

- biological research —
- depression/mental illness metrics
- fear/anxiety/critical thinking metrics — <https://www.wired.com/story/dont-want-to-fall-for-fake-news-dont-be-lazy/>
- lie detection
- psychopath detection
- near-continuous anatomical/physiologic monitoring
- detecting potential tumors at the cubic mm level and monitoring for growth
- detecting liver damage from a new drug in clinical trials using daily/hourly? scans
- detecting efficacy and continuous
