Putting things into perspective doesn't seem to work well as a coping mechanism.  If we have a problem, it doesn't matter that the problem isn't a big deal to anyone else.  It only matters how large a problem it is to us.  When other people try to minimize a problem (mountain) or put it in perspective, that doesn't help to make our mountain smaller to us, it just minimizes us compared to our mountain.
