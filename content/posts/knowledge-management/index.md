[Mark Montgomery's SLA KM list email](http://markmontgomery.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/thanksgiving-thoughts-on-km-from-hmb-ca-08/#comment-26)  

Hello William,

  
  

Thanks for your kind words- I see we have some commonalities. One DoD project I was invited to bid on- a major very sensitive project between two agencies- they allowed a long-term contractor to manage the bidding and award process- who was also bidding on the project.... They were simply trying to gain as much intel from competitors as possible prior to awarding to themselves and partners. In that case the mid sized company was indicted from other projects, but was acquired by one of the giant partners- and I assume all the same people are employed. Cultures are tough to reform- I've tried it in Gov and performed audits in several kinds of organizations.

  
  

My personal blog is about finance and economics, so I have not posted anything on k systems- in part because I have people involved in one and don't want them hurt in anyway from what might be considered controversial. I am considering a blog related to our Kyield system- the network solutions host I have it on was temp.....  years now. I had a full lab set up for a decade, but it was a Dell and MSFT shop and I moved towards CF first and then semantics later so it didn't make any sense to keep throwing money at upgrades. I'm now working from a home office in Half Moon Bay, CA and trying to avoid as much web mastering as I can. Even the blogging software is clunky.

  
  

So for now you can post this if you want and just label me Co-founder and CEO of Kyield with a link to [www.kyield.com](http://www.kyield.com/) . Also cite the SLA please as I go back a long way with many of the members- it was written for them- I wrote this on the fly so it's lacking, but I hoped/supposed better than nothing.

  
  

Good to have your contact- I seem to recall your name from somewhere- read your bio- George Poste is on my personal list- don't know him well, but we share a number of people from AZ- he's been quite interested- don't recall when he left GSK, but you may have crossed paths. -  Mark

  
  
  

I'll take a shot from a broader long-term perspective that may be of  
interest- my lens on KM is shaped from being a business/management  
consultant prior to the Internet era and converting it into a knowledge  
incubator for a decade, building and operating two significant online  
learning networks (small business and global thought leaders), venture  
capital, brief board member on U.S. Gov CIO WG for KM, and finally  
inventor/founder of a holistic multi-disciplinary knowledge system.

  
-During the initial Internet revolution many organizations profited from  
initial efforts that would later be considered KM, particularly in  
competitive intel, seizing opportunities, and knowledge worker productivity.  
  
-As the boom continued, information overload quickly outpaced technical  
innovation in dealing with it. There was a battle between legacy desktop  
systems and the Internet in particular. Standards were slow to be adopted.  
  
- In the late 1990s KM became a fad and credibility was damaged -a large  
portion of those charged with decisions were very unhappy with their KM  
investments and programs. Many KM vendors and consultants fought any attempt  
at accountability and I would say most were anti-technology and/or tools-  
directly conflicting with  important disciplines within the umbrella-  
namely computer science, economics, and anthropology. From my view, academia  
and consultants jumped on the KM bandwagon too early- many were simply too  
greedy before they could even define what it was they were selling or  
teaching.  
  
The fad years were then followed by a period (say 2000-2005) when a number  
of events and trends were occurring simultaneously that were effecting the  
KM umbrella (I don't consider it a single discipline, but rather an umbrella  
discipline, or what I call a mega discipline).  
  
- Academia in particular began to respond to criticism and started to  
improve curriculum which IMO steadily improved credibility.  
  
-A combination of technical trends evolved from the 90s tagging and object  
oriented computing to the more modern version of semantics. Other trends  
included some improvement in proprietary interoperability, the emergence of  
Google and more effective search, growth of handhelds, open source, etc.  
  
-The Asian economic explosion, particularly in China, along with  
globalization more generally, began to rapidly change the global landscape  
on economics and competitiveness. KM was taken more seriously in emerging  
markets than many mature markets, which helped emerging markets improve  
dramatically in terms of competitiveness while many of the more developed  
countries stagnated or declined. Globalization effectively created a need  
for a globally functioning governance system- at least far more functional  
than anything that existed previously.  
  
-A series of very serious crises began with 9/11 and continued with two wars  
(primarily U.S. here, with global affects), Katrina, and now the global  
financial crisis- the former changing the view by the public sector on k  
systems- and the latter radically changing the view on a great deal- to  
include preventative k-systems at the very least, and accountability,  
aligning systems, and more broadly the need for "smarter organizations".  
  
A side note here- many of us had been working for years towards a national  
k-system in the U.S.- I spent a significant amount of time on that goal  
during the past two administrations- several other countries had adopted  
various versions a decade ago. In the U.S. anything above the agency level-  
which means government-wide functionality, requires becoming a priority on  
the White House agenda. The Katrina report finally called for adoption of a  
national KM system- specifically (see my hypothetical business case  
submitted in 2005 that looks amazingly like Katrina....), but it still was  
not a priority above the agency level (it was in some individual agencies).  
  
So we now find ourselves in the midst of a global financial crisis. We are  
hopefully also witnessing a dramatic change in priorities (I see such  
evidence) that includes a move towards adopting smarter systems, to include  
prevention of crises, the need for rapid continual improvement, the need to  
align incentives, the need to provide rational metrics and accountability  
(to include boards), and rational management of the wild west in network  
computing- to include interoperable standards. Among the many lessons  
learned by some recently that others learned long ago is that voluntary  
regulation doesn't work terribly well in industries, particularly when  
hidden or camouflaged.  
  
I would add that we also hopefully collectively learned that free isn't a  
sustainable model. The subsidies that supported many organizations since the  
emergence of the Web and Internet were incredibly unjust, and those that  
were not (in the form of enormous institutional investment providing free  
services via price wars) are over. That said, we are still a long way from  
dealing with the intellectual subsidies (and by extension financial) on the  
Internet relating to content and software. On one extreme we still have  
abusive proprietary market share dominating that encourages a reaction  
that is extreme in the other direction (and unsustainable) expecting  
everything else for free. In much the same way we are as a global culture  
learning about environmental and economic sustainability- we need to learn  
that online (and computing) economics must be sustainable as well.
